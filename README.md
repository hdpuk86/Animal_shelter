## The Spec:

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

### MVP:

 - A list of all their animals and their admission date
 - Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
 - Assign an animal to a new owner
 - List all the owners and their adopted animals

### Possible Extensions:

 - CRUD actions for animals/owners
 - Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
 - Search for animals by breed/type
 - Any other ideas you might come up with
 
## The Rules

The project must be built using only:
  - Sinatra
  - PostGRES SQL
  - HTML / CSS
  - Ruby

It must NOT use:
  - Any Object Relational Mapper
  - JavaScript
  - Authentication

## My Approach

I created class and object diagrams to initially plan out what I would need to do to meet the MVP. I also made use of an activity diagram and use case diagram which I found helpful when it came to drawing up a site map. I then used my plans to come up with the wireframes.

At first I just concentrated on getting the MVP up and running as fast as possible but I included the CRUD actions as part of my MVP. Once I had this all in place I concentrated on styling before moving through the extensions. 

## The Outcome

I managed to meet the MVP within 3 days which meant I was also able to go on and complete the extension tasks. Overall I was fairly happy with my styling and managed to keep to my initial wireframes. I was also able to move on and create some extra features such as boxes on the owner profiles that match them with pets in the shelter based on their preferences, extra boxes on the homepage which update as actions are taken around the site.
